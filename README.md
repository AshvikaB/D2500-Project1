## Description:

This project analyzes the relationship between air pollution and COVID-19 during 2020. The goal is to explore whether air pollution decreased due to COVID-19 and which country, the US or India, experienced the most significant change in air pollution during this year.

The project uses two datasets:

Air Pollution Data: Air pollution levels for various cities in the US and India in 2020.

Did air pollution decrease due to covid in 2020? 
Which country experienced the most change in air pollution in 2020?
